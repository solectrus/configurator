## Prerequisites

Beside having a Raspberry Pi with a 64bit OS and Kernel v4 or higher, you need to have **Docker** installed and running. The following steps will guide you through the installation process.

Now let's get started and log in to your Raspi via SSH.

### Check your OS

First, ensure you have a 64bit OS with Kernel v4 or higher. Check your OS and architecture, which should look like this:

```console
$ uname -a
Linux MyRaspi 6.1.21-v8+ #1642 SMP PREEMPT Mon Apr  3 17:24:16 BST 2023 aarch64 GNU/Linux

$ dpkg --print-architecture
arm64
```

The kernel is `v6`, which is the latest and greatest - `v4` or `v5` will work as well.

The architecture is `arm64` which means you are running a 64bit OS. If you are running a 32bit OS, you need to upgrade. If the architecture is `armhf`, you are running a 64bit Kernel with 32bit userland, which will **not** work.'

The easiest way to setup a brand new OS is to use the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) and install Raspberry Pi OS Lite (Debian Bookworm, 64bit) on a SD card.

### Prepare Docker

Ensure Docker is installed and running. First, check your Docker version:

```console
$ docker --version
Docker version 26.0.0, build 2ae903e

$ docker compose version
Docker Compose version v2.25.0
```

An older version might work as well. If you don't have Docker installed, please follow the [official instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/) to install.

Don't forget to add your user to the `docker` group, so you don't need to use `sudo` for every Docker command.

```console
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

**Important:** Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.

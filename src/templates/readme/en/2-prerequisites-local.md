## Prerequisites

Log into your Linux machine via SSH.

### Check your OS

Ensure you have a 64bit OS with Kernel v4 or higher

Check your OS and architecture, which should look like this:

```console
$ uname -a
Linux raspberrypi 6.1.21-v8+ #1642 SMP PREEMPT Mon Apr  3 17:24:16 BST 2023 aarch64 GNU/Linux

$ dpkg --print-architecture
arm64
```

The kernel is `v6`, which is the latest and greatest - `v4` or `v5` will work as well.

The architecture is `arm64` which means you are running a 64bit OS. If you are running a 32bit OS, you need to upgrade. If the architecture is `armhf`, you are running a 64bit Kernel with 32bit userland, which will **not** work.'

If you have a Raspberry Pi: The easiest way to setup a brand new OS is to use the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) and install Raspberry Pi OS Lite (Debian Bookworm, 64bit) on a SD card.

### Prepare Docker

Ensure Docker is installed and running. First, check your Docker version:

```console
$ docker --version
Docker version 26.0.0, build 2ae903e

$ docker compose version
Docker Compose version v2.25.0
```

If you don't have Docker installed, follow the [official instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/) to install.

Don't forget to add your user to the `docker` group, so you don't need to use `sudo` for every Docker command.

```console
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.

You can read more about this [post-installation steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) in the official Docker documentation.

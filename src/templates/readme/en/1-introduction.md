# Installation Guide

This is your personalized guide for installing %{part}, created based on your answers. The key elements are the two files `compose.yml` and `.env` located in the tabs next to this one. They contain all the information you need for installing and running SOLECTRUS.

**WARNING:** The configurator is under heavy development and involves installing beta versions of Docker images. The guide is currently available in English, with the final version to be available in German as well. Please report any issues you encounter!

# Installation Guide

This is your personalized guide for installing %{part}, created individually based on your answers. It consists of three parts:

- The `README.md` file, which you are currently reading
- The `compose.yml` file, which contains the services that are started in Docker containers
- The `.env` file, which contains the environment variables for the Docker containers

You can switch between them using the links above. The `compose.yml` and `.env` can be copied to the clipboard. You will need this later.

**PLEASE NOTE:** This configurator is still quite new. Please report any issues on GitHub at [https://github.com/solectrus/configurator/issues](https://github.com/solectrus/configurator/issues).

Now read on to do the installation on your Linux machine.

## Create folders for configuration and data storage

Choose a folder where you want to store the configuration and Docker volumes. This guide assumes you have a folder `/~/solectrus` which is located in the home folder of the current user. You can create this folder with the required subfolders with the following commands:

```console
cd ~
mkdir -p solectrus
cd solectrus
mkdir %{folders}
```
